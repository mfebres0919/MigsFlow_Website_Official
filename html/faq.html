                  <p>Custom code is lean, fast, and built only with what your website actually needs. Website builders often come with extra features and plugins running in the background that you may never use, which can slow things down. <br><br>It can also be more secure. With a hand coded site, there are fewer moving parts, fewer third party plugins, and no admin dashboard for someone to try to break into. In other words, there’s simply less stuff for hackers to mess with. Clean, simple, and a lot harder to poke at. <br><br>And of course, custom code gives you more flexibility and uniqueness. Your site is built around your brand, not boxed into a template. Basically, no extra fluff. Just the good stuff.</p>

                  <p>Yes. You’ll purchase your domain (your website name) and a hosting plan so your site can be live online. I’ll guide you through the setup and connect everything for you. <br><br>I recommend buying your domain through Porkbun and hosting through Netlify, and the hosting cost is typically around $9–$20/month depending on your needs and traffic.</p>
